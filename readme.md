### Design the drawing sheet
> The game is about drawing on the canvas.
- W900 * H700 pixel is the size of the canvas.
- Each side has 25 pixel for margin, and 25 * 25 pixel / block.
- The real width for the snack to move is 34 * 25 = 850 pixel, the total width: 25 + 34 * 25 + 25 = 900.
- The title's size: 850 * 54.
- The real height is 600 for the snake to move, because it includes a title 54, margin up and down 22, total height: 11 + 54 + 10 + 24 * 25 + 25 = 700.
- The snake's body is made of blocks of 25 * 25 pixel.
- The top left block's axis is X: 25, Y: 75.
- Think about the how to locate each move of the snake by X and Y.
- Think about the food's location.
